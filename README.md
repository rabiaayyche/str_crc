## STR in CRC cancer - Master Internship (ZHAW)
This repository contains the analysis performed as part of an internship at the ICLS of the ZHAW.
The aim was to identify short tandem repeats (STR) associated with alternative splicing. It was investigated whether there is a correlation between the STR mean length and the Percent Spliced-In (PSI) values of the splicing event. 

The analysis was performed for colorectal cancer CRC data from the TCGA database. The alternative splicing data was obtained from both the SpliceSeq and SplAdder databases.
